# University Website

A simple multi-page university-themed website I built a couple of years ago while learning **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.  
It features a navigation bar, dark/light mode toggle, and sample pages for **Home**, **Contact**, and **Academics**.

## ðŸ“– About This Project

This project was my way of practicing:
- Structuring multiple HTML pages and linking them together
- Styling with CSS (including variables for theme colors)
- Adding basic interactivity with JavaScript
- Working with images and layouts

Itâ€™s not a fully responsive, production-ready site, but itâ€™s a solid foundation for learning the basics of front-end web development.
